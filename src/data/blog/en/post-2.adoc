:description: This article explains how to integrate the latest Tailwind CSS v4 into an Astro project and its benefits.

== Introduction

In this post, I will explain the steps and considerations for introducing Tailwind CSS v4 to an Astro project to efficiently build modern designs. Tailwind CSS v4 brings significant improvements over previous versions, providing a faster development experience and superior performance.

== Introducing Tailwind CSS v4

The easiest way to use Tailwind CSS v4 in an Astro project is to use the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin. By adding the following configuration to `astro.config.mjs`, you can leverage the features of Tailwind CSS v4 through Vite.

.Title of this code
[source,js]
----
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";

export default defineConfig({
    vite: {
        plugins: [tailwindcss()],
    },
});
----

With this configuration, you can use the `@tailwind` directive in your CSS files and proceed with styling using a utility-first approach.

== Utilizing the Typography Plugin

For content-centric sites like blogs, applying appropriate typography is crucial. By introducing the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin, you can automatically apply readable default styles simply by applying the `prose` class to HTML elements.

First, install the plugin with `pnpm add -D @tailwindcss/typography`, and import `@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography";` in a CSS file such as `global.css`.

[source,css]
----
@import "tailwindcss";
@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography";

/* Other global styles */
----

Then, simply add the `prose` class to the element surrounding your article content, and beautiful typography will be applied to elements such as headings, paragraphs, and lists.

== Conclusion

The combination of Astro and Tailwind CSS v4 is a very powerful choice in terms of both performance and developer experience. Especially when building content-driven websites, you will be able to maximize the benefits of both.

Please give it a try in your project as well.
