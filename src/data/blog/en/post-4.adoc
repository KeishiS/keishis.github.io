:description: I tried out a trending UI library. Here are my thoughts and notes on the installation process.

== Motivation

We were looking for a more flexible and lightweight library to revamp the project's design system.

== Impressions

The API is intuitive and works great with TypeScript.
However, some parts of the documentation are not yet comprehensive, so I had to figure out some implementations by trial and error.
