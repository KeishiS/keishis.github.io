== Basic Definitions and Theorems

We use AsciiDoc's custom roles to describe definitions and theorems.

[.definition]
.Definition {counter:definition-num} (Prime Number)
====
A natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself is called a *prime number*.
====

[.theorem]
.Theorem {counter:theorem-num} (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic)
====
Every integer greater than 1 either is a prime number itself or can be represented as the product of prime numbers, and this representation is unique, up to the order of the factors.
====

[.proof]
.Proof
====
(Proof omitted)
It can be shown by mathematical induction.
====

== Propositions and Lemmas

[.proposition]
.Proposition {counter:proposition-num}
====
Any even number is divisible by 2.
====

[.lemma]
.Lemma {lemma-num}
====
If \( n^2 \) is an even number, then \( n \) is also an even number.
====

[.proof]
.Proof
====
We prove the contrapositive. If \( n \) is an odd number, then \( n \) can be written as \( n = 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \).
Then \( n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1 \), which is an odd number.
Since the contrapositive is true, the original proposition is also true.
====

== Describing Corollaries

[.corollary]
.Corollary
====
There are infinitely many prime numbers.
====

== Application: Euler's Formula

[.theorem]
.Theorem {theorem-num} (Euler's Formula)
====
For any \( \theta \in \mathbb{R} \), the following holds:

[stem]
++++
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta
++++
====

[.proof]
.Proof
====
Defined using Taylor series expansion.
Derived by substituting \( x = i\theta \) into the Maclaurin series expansions of \( e^x, \sin x, \cos x \) and comparing.
